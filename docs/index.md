## Architecture & decisions (ADRs)

Append-only; supersede with a new number or a dated addendum, never rewrite the
decision. See "When to add an ADR" in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

- [adr/0001](adr/0001-auto-updates-via-tauri-updater.md) — auto-updates via the Tauri updater on a separate public releases repo
- [adr/0002](adr/0002-live-transcript-preview-strategy.md) — live transcript preview as an ephemeral companion, not the source of truth
- [adr/0003](adr/0003-release-candidate-channel-and-promotion.md) — rc channel + promote-to-stable (every stable release starts as an RC) (superseded by desvincular-repo-ci)
- [adr/0004](adr/0004-out-of-process-system-audio-helper.md) — macOS system audio via an out-of-process helper (file IPC + Unix signals)
- [adr/0005](adr/0005-source-separated-audio-capture.md) — one WAV per source, re-interleaved as turns
- [adr/0006](adr/0006-embed-hermes-sandboxed-runtime.md) — embed the pinned Hermes runtime as sandboxed child processes (superseded by ADR-0038)
- [adr/0007](adr/0007-model-capability-source-of-truth.md) — capabilities come from the provider catalog, not marketing traits; the 2026-10-08 addendum replaces Venice with OpenRouter
- [adr/0008](adr/0008-image-generation-and-editing-tools.md) — image generation/editing: `/image` fast path + LLM tools; the 2026-10-08 addendum replaces the historical Venice adapter with fal
- [adr/0009](adr/0009-hermes-config-shared-ownership-merge.md) — config.yaml is shared with the Hermes dashboard; Clovy deep-merges on spawn, never overwrites (superseded by ADR-0038)
- [adr/0010](adr/0010-note-references-in-agent-chat.md) — note references in agent chat: `@note:<id>` text token + `get_meeting_note` fetch-by-id
- [adr/0011](adr/0011-bundled-hermes-skills.md) — selected Hermes skills ship as read-only app resources when the runtime pin cannot move (superseded by ADR-0038)
- [adr/0012](adr/0012-direct-issue-report-submission.md) — issue reports submit directly (no client model turn, nothing to charge); Clovy API generates the team-facing diagnosis
- [adr/0013](adr/0013-stream-inference-responses-through-june-api.md) — inference responses stream through Clovy API (SSE pass-through + keep-alive heartbeats); charges settle after the stream ends
- [adr/0013](adr/0013-agent-recorder-tool-via-frontend-event.md) — agent recording control: the recorder tool asks the main webview to start or stop through a frontend event, so capture always runs the visible UI path (shares the 0013 number with the streaming ADR)
- [adr/0014](adr/0014-pinned-dictation-paste-target.md) — the dictation paste target is pinned when the recording stops, never re-resolved at paste time
- [adr/0015](adr/0015-video-generation-tools.md) — `/video` fast path + LLM tools, async job + poll; the 2026-10-08 addendum replaces Venice quotes with endpoint-specific fal estimates
- [adr/0016](adr/0016-private-connectors-local-mode.md) — private connectors (local mode): Keychain-only token custody, app-proxied MCP calls straight to Google, trust modes enforced in the Rust proxy, earned autonomy, event-trigger daemon
- [adr/0017](adr/0017-browser-use-via-june-extension.md) — browser use in the user's own browser via the Clovy extension, two tracks behind one broker; computer use productizes the pinned toolset (MCP-server shape superseded by ADR-0040)
- [adr/0018](adr/0018-session-model-changes-apply-at-agent-run-boundaries.md) — session model changes are staged at Send and applied only at the next idle agent-run boundary
- [adr/0019](adr/0019-windows-dictation-helper.md) — Windows dictation uses a platform-native helper process
- [adr/0020](adr/0020-windows-dictation-keyboard-hook.md) — Windows shortcuts combine `RegisterHotKey` with a narrow keyboard hook
- [adr/0021](adr/0021-june-api-v1-compatibility-policy.md) — `/v1` is additive-only for shipped app versions: per-version contract fixtures gate CI and production promotes, clients send `x-june-app-version`, error codes never renumber
- [adr/0022](adr/0022-venice-private-first-model-routing.md) — historical Venice/Phala routing and privacy decision; the 2026-10-08 addendum replaces it with OpenRouter without inherited TEE or zero-retention claims
- [adr/0023](adr/0023-attested-os-api-service-chain.md) - superseded by ADR-0024
- [adr/0024](adr/0024-independent-product-verification.md) - Clovy, Open Software API, and Chat publish independent verification evidence without cross-product release pinning (superseded by desvincular-repo-ci)
- [adr/0025](adr/0025-targeted-hermes-approval-protocol.md) - MCP approvals use stable request identity, targeted resolution, bounded queues, and fail-closed retirement (superseded by ADR-0038)
- [adr/0026](adr/0026-durable-note-transcription-jobs.md) - saved-audio Source spans use durable, fingerprinted, idempotent note-transcription jobs
- [adr/0027](adr/0027-june-owned-project-memory-store.md) — memory entries live in Clovy's SQLite (not the Hermes memory toolset), scoped by project, agent writes via the loopback proxy, project context by prompt injection
- [adr/0028](adr/0028-private-stdio-broker-for-computer-use.md) - Computer use runs through a Clovy-owned private stdio driver broker with signed-helper TCC identity, task-scoped app authorization, and exact-window Stage Manager restoration (MCP-server shape superseded by ADR-0040)
- [adr/0029](adr/0029-dual-architecture-hermes-runtime.md) - the universal macOS app carries complete arm64 and x86_64 Hermes runtime trees and executes both before release (superseded by ADR-0038)
- [adr/0030](adr/0030-explicit-per-session-profile-targeting.md) — profile switching writes the sticky active profile AND threads it explicitly on session.create; no per-profile Hermes process
- [adr/0031](adr/0031-per-profile-data-isolation.md) — profiles isolate user data (notes/dictation/projects via a `profile` column, chat sessions via a `session_profiles` map); profile is the first data-partition key; delete prompts move-to-default vs delete
- [adr/0032](adr/0032-session-completion-june-owned-local-state.md) — marking a session complete is Clovy-owned local SQLite state keyed by the stored Hermes session id, orthogonal to Hermes' archive flag; mirrors the `session_folders` stack
- [adr/0033](adr/0033-notion-hosted-mcp-connect-preview.md) - Notion hosted MCP connector preview with read-only `june_notion`, approved page creation and updates, and no selected-resource claim
- [adr/0034](adr/0034-obsidian-vault-discovery-mcp.md) - Obsidian vault discovery uses a Clovy-owned MCP server, not an ambient environment variable (MCP-server shape superseded by ADR-0040)
- [adr/0035](adr/0035-extension-releases-follow-desktop-rc-promotion.md) - Chrome Web Store packages are reviewed during desktop RC and the exact staged bytes publish after stable desktop promotion (superseded by desvincular-repo-ci)
- [adr/0036](adr/0036-github-connector-app-user-tokens.md) - GitHub connector uses GitHub App user access tokens only (no app private key on device or backend), local-mode custody per ADR-0016, Clovy-side read/write gating, approval-only writes
- [adr/0037](adr/0037-versioned-local-sqlite-migrations.md) - Clovy's local SQLite schema uses an append-only release-ordered catalog, introspection-based legacy stamping, and one transaction for all pending migrations
- [adr/0038](adr/0038-june-owned-openai-agents-runtime.md) - Clovy owns the local agent harness, persistence, tools, approvals, and stdio protocol on top of the OpenAI Agents SDK
- [adr/0039](adr/0039-june-owned-routines-and-mcp.md) - Clovy owns routine scheduling and user-configured MCP transport, persistence, safety, and migration
- [adr/0040](adr/0040-plugin-capabilities-as-host-tools.md) - Clovy-owned plugin capabilities are in-loop host tools (brokered helpers for risky engines), never Clovy-managed MCP servers
- [adr/0041](adr/0041-june-companion-trust-boundaries.md) - original companion trust boundaries, relay-first E2EE, and desktop authority
- [adr/0042](adr/0042-june-companion-native-swiftui.md) - native SwiftUI companion presentation; its mobile-login decision is superseded by ADRs 0043, 0046, and 0047
- [adr/0043](adr/0043-companion-desktop-authorized-device-credential.md) - desktop-authorized pairing and revocable device credentials; its authorization model is current again through ADR 0047
- [adr/0044](adr/0044-companion-device-generates-relay-credential.md) - companion-generated relay credentials; Clovy API receives and stores only their hashes
- [adr/0045](adr/0045-companion-relay-single-replica-mvp.md) - the MVP relay is single-replica until pairing and live routing have shared cross-instance state
- [adr/0046](adr/0046-companion-native-os-accounts-login.md) - superseded by ADR-0047
- [adr/0047](adr/0047-companion-pairing-is-mobile-authorization.md) - the authenticated Desktop-created QR pairing is the phone's short-lived authorization; the phone has no account session
- [adr/0048](adr/0048-companion-mutations-use-durable-at-most-once-reservations.md) - companion mutations reserve their operation id durably before side effects and never redispatch an outcome-unknown request
- [adr/0049](adr/0049-cancelled-dictation-takes-never-deliver.md) - each helper-owned dictation take has one cancellation token, and cancelled takes cannot start later cleanup, history, or text delivery
- [adr/0050](adr/0050-linear-official-hosted-mcp.md) - Linear agent capabilities come from Linear's official hosted MCP while Clovy owns connection state, credential custody, and conservative approvals
- [adr/0051](adr/0051-companion-attachments-use-bounded-staging-and-opaque-mac-references.md) - companion attachments use bounded app-data staging and opaque, user-granted Mac file references
- [adr/0052](adr/0052-companion-media-results-use-canonical-artifacts.md) - companion image/video results reuse canonical agent artifacts and cross E2EE only as bounded references plus verified full-file chunks
- [adr/0053](adr/0053-companion-computer-use-approvals-are-one-shot.md) - linked companions may approve one exact Computer use interruption under the desktop policy ceiling, with a short-lived one-shot permit
- [adr/0054](adr/0054-clovy-presentation-retains-june-era-technical-identities.md) - Clovy is the product name while shipped June-era bundle, storage, API, update, and tool identities remain stable
- [adr/0055](adr/0055-clovy-technical-identity-migrates-through-a-compatibility-bridge.md) - supersedes ADR-0054: Clovy becomes canonical through idempotent migration and rollback-safe aliases while immutable OS identities preserve existing installs
- [adr/0056](adr/0056-interface-language-uses-an-in-repo-typed-catalog.md) - interface language (English, Português (Brasil)) uses an in-repo typed catalog, a localStorage preference independent of the transcription language, and a Tauri event mirrored into the native menus
- [adr/0057](adr/0057-activity-database-uses-sqlcipher-linked-app-wide.md) - the activity database is a separate SQLCipher file with a Keychain key; SQLCipher is linked app-wide on macOS and the unkeyed main database is unaffected
- [adr/0058](adr/0058-clovy-mcp-server-relays-to-the-running-app.md) - the Clovy MCP server is a stdio relay (`clovy-mcp`) to the running app over a same-user Unix socket with an installation secret; the binary never opens the databases
- [adr/0059](adr/0059-activity-is-per-installation-not-per-data-partition.md) - activity (timeline and coding-agent blocks) belongs to the installation, not to a data partition; MCP activity tools read it like the "Today" view while notes, dictations, and memories stay in the current partition
- [adr/0060](adr/0060-development-app-runs-as-a-signed-bundle-that-owns-its-grants.md) - `pnpm tauri:dev` runs a signed `Clovy Dev.app` beside Cargo's output that owns its privacy grants: no TCC resets, one Apple Development identity for the app and its helpers, and a launcher that disclaims the terminal's responsibility
- [adr/0061](adr/0061-dates-and-numbers-follow-the-interface-language.md) - dates, times, and numbers always format in the interface language (supersedes ADR-0056 decision 4); the date-format preference only picks day/month order; native errors are worded by stable code in the frontend
- [adr/0062](adr/0062-cli-engines-are-the-default-agent-native-harness-is-legacy.md) - Claude Code, else Codex, is the default engine of new sessions, note chat, Home (since ADR-0064), companion sessions, and Auto routines (unattended, read-only tools plus Clovy's MCP and web); one recorded settings move; the Clovy agent stays as legacy (supersedes ADR-0038/0039 in part)
- [adr/0063](adr/0063-cli-turns-get-write-tools-through-an-approval-broker.md) - (proposed) CLI chat turns get Clovy's write tools through a turn-bound `clovy-mcp` connection and an in-app approval broker; external clients stay read-only; user MCP servers and Linear reach CLIs through the same gateway
- [adr/0064](adr/0064-home-runs-on-the-default-cli-engine.md) - Home runs on the default CLI engine in its hidden session, without Clovy API; old Home turns are imported once from local storage; the Clovy API Home commands are removed (supersedes ADR-0062 in part)
- [adr/0065](adr/0065-dictation-calls-the-users-own-provider-directly.md) - with the user's own Groq or OpenRouter key, dictation transcription and cleanup go straight from the desktop to that provider carrying only that key; service keys stay in Clovy API

## Enforceable rules (spec/)

Coding rules that should fail review if violated (distinct from the `specs/`
feature specs). Full index: [spec/index.md](../spec/index.md).

- UI copy: [spec/sentence-case](../spec/sentence-case.md), [spec/no-typographic-dashes](../spec/no-typographic-dashes.md), [spec/no-all-caps](../spec/no-all-caps.md)
- UI styling: [spec/icons-central-only](../spec/icons-central-only.md), [spec/design-tokens](../spec/design-tokens.md), [spec/no-tabular-numerals](../spec/no-tabular-numerals.md)
- Typography: [spec/type-scale](../spec/type-scale.md), [spec/font-weights](../spec/font-weights.md), [spec/font-families](../spec/font-families.md)
- Controls: [spec/control-sizes](../spec/control-sizes.md)
- Agent surface: [spec/mcp-tool-naming](../spec/mcp-tool-naming.md)

## Design system

The extracted design system: tokens, primitives, and the rules around them (see
the `spec/` entries above for the enforceable versions).

- [design/foundations.md](design/foundations.md) — theming model, token roles, and the type system (scale, heading mapping, two-weight system, family roles); ends with the pass-2 deviations worklist
- [design/components.md](design/components.md) — pattern-to-canonical-answer map for the shared `src/components/ui/` primitives, the settings markup contract, and what is not yet systematized
- [design/conventions.md](design/conventions.md) — flat-namespace naming, interaction and visual rules, theming pipeline, and how to open or extend the styleguide page
- [design/taste.md](design/taste.md) — the sensibility behind the rules (quiet by default, weight as punctuation, color spent not sprayed); the portable layer for other projects

## Agent skill config (docs/agents/)

Per-repo config the engineering skills read before acting (see the
"Agent skills" section in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)).

- [agents/triage-labels.md](agents/triage-labels.md) — the five triage roles mapped to harness ticket states
- [agents/domain.md](agents/domain.md) — single-context layout; how skills consume CONTEXT.md and ADRs
- [agents/collaboration.md](agents/collaboration.md) — how agents build, delegate, and review across harnesses: the skill family map, reviewer-is-never-the-author, trust levels

## Security

- [../SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) — vulnerability reporting + supported versions
