//! The whole process tree of a spawned child.
//!
//! A child that forks helpers (dev servers, node workers, MCP servers) must
//! not leave them behind when it is cancelled or times out: killing the child
//! alone would orphan them and leave its pipes open.
//!
//! - Unix: the child is spawned with `process_group(0)`; signalling the group
//!   reaches every helper.
//! - Windows: there are no process groups. The child is created suspended,
//!   placed in a Job Object, and only then resumed, so it cannot start a
//!   process outside the job; its descendants join the job when they are
//!   created, and killing the tree terminates the job. The job is also
//!   closed with `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`, so dropping the tree sweeps whatever is
//!   left (an npm `codex.cmd` runs `cmd.exe` -> `node` -> `codex.exe`). A
//!   child that cannot be placed in the job is killed before it runs and the
//!   spawn fails.
