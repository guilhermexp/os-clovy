//! Per-note serial processing queue.
//!
//! Audio *capture* is globally single-instance (see `audio::capture`), but
//! *processing* (transcribe → generate) runs asynchronously after a recording
//! stops. Stopping frees the capture slot immediately, so a user can record
//! another message on the same note while the previous one is still being
//! transcribed or generated.
//!
//! Those follow-up recordings must still be processed **in order**: generation
//! is incremental and feeds the note's existing generated content back in as
//! context, so job N has to finish before job N+1 reads that context. This
//! queue serializes processing per note and tracks how many jobs are waiting so
//! the UI can surface a count.
