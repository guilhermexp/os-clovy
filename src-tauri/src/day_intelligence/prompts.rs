pub const HOUR_REPORT: &str = "\
You turn one hour of a person's computer activity into a short report.

Input: a distilled excerpt of what was on screen (grouped by app and window, \
with local times), the hour's sessions with their measured minutes, and, when \
present, coding-agent sessions and meetings.

Answer with one JSON object:
- \"summary\": two or three sentences on what was done this hour, high level, \
understandable by anyone; keep concrete names (tickets, pull requests, files, \
documents, people) that the excerpt shows.
- \"activities\": the distinct things done this hour, most time first; each has \
\"description\" (one sentence starting with a past-tense verb, no clock times) \
and \"minutes\" (your estimate of the time spent on it).

Rules: describe only what the input shows; never invent work. Group small \
related steps into one activity. Leisure or personal browsing is an activity \
too, described plainly. The minutes are only proportions: the app rescales them \
to the measured active time.";

pub const WORKSTREAM_FOLD: &str = "\
You keep the list of workstreams of a person's day: the threads of work the \
day was made of. You receive the current workstreams (each with an id, title, \
and summary) and the numbered activities of one new hour.

Place this hour's activities only. Answer with one JSON object with \
\"placements\": one entry per workstream that receives activities this hour:
- \"workstream_id\": the id of an existing workstream when the activities \
continue it, or 0 to open a new workstream;
- \"title\": for a new workstream, a short title (at most 8 words) naming the \
work; for an existing one, repeat its title unchanged;
- \"summary\": the whole story of that workstream so far in 1 to 4 short \
sentences, including what this hour added;
- \"activities\": the numbers of this hour's activities that belong to it.

Rules: prefer an existing workstream when the work continues it; open a new \
one only for clearly different work. Every activity number goes to exactly one \
placement. Never rename, merge, or drop existing workstreams, and do not \
mention workstreams that receive nothing this hour.";

pub const DAY_SUMMARY: &str = "\
You write the end-of-day summary of a person's working day from what their \
Mac recorded: the day's workstreams with their measured minutes, the hourly \
reports, the meetings and notes recorded in Clovy, and coding-agent sessions.

Answer with one JSON object:
- \"headline\": one line (at most 12 words) capturing the shape of the day;
- \"narrative\": a short paragraph (3 to 5 sentences) telling the story of the \
day, mentioning meetings by their note title;
- \"insights\": 2 or 3 observations, each with a \"title\" (at most 5 words) \
and a \"text\" (one sentence), about focus, context switching, or progress;
- \"standup\": an object with \"done\" (what was accomplished), \
\"in_progress\" (what is still going on), and \"blockers\" (problems that \
stopped or slowed the work; empty when there were none), each a list of short \
past-tense or present-tense lines ready to paste into a team chat.

Rules: use only facts from the input; never invent work, people, or numbers. \
Do not restate the measured totals (the app shows them next to your text). \
Keep ticket keys, pull request numbers, and file names exactly as written.";

const ENGLISH_DIRECTIVE: &str = "Write every text value in English.";

const PORTUGUESE_DIRECTIVE: &str = "\
Write every text value in Brazilian Portuguese (português do Brasil). Keep \
every JSON key exactly as named above, in English; translate only the values. \
Keep ticket keys, pull request numbers, file names, and note titles as written.";
